Welcome to FRDM-IMX93 for NXP CUP!
==================================

About this project
------------------

Through a series of guides and various pieces of documentation, this project aims
to help the students participating in the `NXP CUP`_ contest get started with the
development on the `FRDM-IMX93`_ board.

The software provided in this project is meant to be run as an application in the
context of the `Zephyr RTOS`_, which is why you'll notice the usage of tools such
as `west`_, `ninja`_, and `cmake`_.

Getting started guides
----------------------

Check out the following guides to help you prepare your development environment:

- âœ… :doc:`Getting acquainted with the FRDM-IMX93 board <development_board>`
- âœ… :doc:`Preparing the development environment (Linux) <linux_setup>`
- âœ… :doc:`Preparing the development environment (Windows) <windows_setup>`
- âœ… :doc:`Booting the FRDM-IMX93 board <booting_the_board>`
- âœ… :doc:`Writing your own application <writing_your_application>`

Tutorials

.. _supported-samples:

Supported samples
-----------------

Want to test out a certain functionality/hardware module? Check out this list of
supported samples:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 30
   :align: center

   * - Sample name
     - Hardware

   * - :ref:`hello-world-sample`
     - N/A

   * - :ref:`servo-sample`
     - :ref:`MG996R servo motor <mg996r-hw>`

   * - :ref:`hbridge-sample`
     - :ref:`L298N H-BRIDGE <l298n-hw>`

   * - :ref:`pixy2-sample`
     - :ref:`Pixy2 camera <pixy2-camera-hw>`

Is your hardware module not listed here? That's fine! You can use one
of the supported modules as a starting point and add support for your own.

Sample API documentation
------------------------

Check out the `main <doxygen/index.html>`_ documentation page for the various
APIs used throughout the samples.

.. _issues-and-contributions:

Issues and contributions
------------------------

Since this is an open-source project, all kinds of contributions are encouraged
and highly appreciated. Your contribution will help improve the infrastructure
and guides for future editions of the contest.

If you encounter a bug or an issue, please make sure you file a report under
the `Issues`_ tab of our `GitHub repository`_. Additionally, we encourage
students to try and fix the issues/bugs themselves by submitting a pull
request.

Contributing to the `Zephyr project`_ is also highly encouraged. To do so,
please make sure you follow the `Contributing to Zephyr`_ guide. We
recommend checking out the aforementioned guide before contributing to this
project as well.
